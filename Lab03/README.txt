Lab 3: Matrix Algebra Calculator

Files modifed: MathMatrix.c, mml.c

MathMatrix: This is the file that contains all logic for matrix manipulation. We
only handled a 3x3 matrix and it did: multiplacation, addition, scalar
multiplacation, scalar addition, transpose, inverse, and got the detetminaint.
We were only allowed to use for loops and it was fairly easy to implement
considering I already have a knowledge of Linear algebra.


mml.c: This was fairly easy to implement as well. I got some help from the TA
making the template, and I was able to implement the tests just fine. I did use
an online calculator to calculate some of the answers and stuff to quicken my
time.

I did not really have any difficulty. It was a fun lab. I would suggest to
myself to start a bit earlier, but I was able to finish quite quickly anyways.
