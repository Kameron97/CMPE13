Lab 4: RPN Calculator


This lab is basically the function RPN, which uses a stack in order to calculate
numbers. I will be honest, i've done this in c++ in Mackey's class except it was
called the DC calculator but it was the same function as this one. I really had
no problem making this program because i made a complexor program in CMPS 109 in
C++. Plus we already had made a calculator in CE 13 already so it wasn't
un-doable.  Not to mention I have already taken CMPS 12B/101, so making a stack
was fairly simple to implement and prune.

I do have an error in my lab, in which i keep getting numbers printed when i
press random inputs like 'l' or 'x'. And i was not able to fix it. I like to
call it a feature.

Files included in this lab are:

rpn.c which is the calculator function
Stack.c: is the stack for rpn.c
