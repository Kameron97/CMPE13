I worked on this project by myself.

Lab 9 parter: Hasson Qayum, hqayum@ucsc.edu


Thwe point of this lab was to familarize ourselves with the IO of the pic32. We were supposed to know how the buttons, switches, and OLEDs actually work
and get expierence on how to manipulate it. In part1, we make the LEDs of the micro-controller go back and forth. The lights will slow up/speed down depending on
how many switches are on or off. In part 2, we made an OLED display that showed some basic divison on the OLED. in part 3 we use the buttons to display LEDS.

My approach to the lab was to follow the guide that was given by the handout. I had to ask for alot of help on part 3 since the instructions were very vague and hard to understand
However, I think the lab went fine over all and I would not change my approach that much since I got everything to work.

The part I had most difficulty on was part 3. I had alot of trouble implementing the Button library. It was very difficult to figure out since since the instructions were very vague.
I got help from my Tutor in MEP and in section to help me out.
