Got help from my MEP tutor, Chris.

This lab is a linkedlist that stores words in the LinkedList. We then use an algorithm to sort the list 
alphabetically and then by amount of letters.

I believe the important part of this lab was actually making the  Linkedlist. It is a very important part of the lab 
because it is the array or tool that is being used to store the data.

My approach for this lab was to make the Linkedlist first. I went down the list of the given functions for the
Linkedlist and implemented them and tested them in GBD. I read the manual first to know what the heck I was
supposed to do and then followed the guidelines set by the manual. I got help from my MEP TA on how to implement
the algorithms.

my lab completely works and I tested it with the given data and it was able to order the list correctly.
It took me about 5 hours to do. It was pretty easy, but I should have started earlier because I missed my bus home 
and now am sleeping on campus
