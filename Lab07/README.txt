Lab 7 - toaster_oven

This was fairly difficult assignemnt. I followed the guidelines set by the lab manual,
but still could not work out changing the temperature for bake. Everything else worked
as predicted, however my  time/temperature display were buggy in the sense, they would
randomly change, but when i went to move the temperaure they would be correct.
