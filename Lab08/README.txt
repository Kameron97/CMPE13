lab8- Morse Code


Partner for lab9: Hasam Qayum


This lab is basically supposed to decode Morse code. Dots would be a button
press, while dashes would be held a bit longer. it would then covert them into
letters/symbols after x number of seconds.


This lab was much easier than lab 7 i felt. The most important part was getting
morse.c down. this handled most of the logic of the lab. At least the logic
dealing with the buttons. lab8.c was not that hard because it was mostly if/else
statements dependent on the output of morse.c functions.

I read the manual twice on the lab and got a general idea of what to do. I then
went to wikipedia for help on what the heck morse code was because i did not
know how encoding works for it. After figuring all of that out I went to a Lab
and asked for additional help. I iniatelly started out on tree.c because that
literally took me less than 2 minutes to complete because I have already taken
both CMPS 12B and CMPS 101. i then went to complete with Morse.c after
understanding what Morse code was. Then finally to Lab8.c

My lab works for the most part, I event got the extra credit to work. However, I
have a bug that there is a space between every character and spacing does not
work at all. I could not get help from a TA since i finished this last minute.
